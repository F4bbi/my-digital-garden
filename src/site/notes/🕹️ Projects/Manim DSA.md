# Manim DSA

[Manim DSA](https://github.com/F4bbi/manim-dsa) is the project I‚Äôm most proud of. It started as my bachelor thesis after my algorithms professor asked if anyone wanted to continue the [ManimGraphLibrary](https://verdianapasqualini.github.io/ManimGraphLibrary/index.html), a project by a colleague from the course. That‚Äôs when I discovered Manim, the open-source animation library created by the founder of the 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel.

Manim DSA (short for Manim Data Structures & Algorithms) is a Manim plugin I developed to animate common data structures and algorithms.

The idea was born from my desire to visualize algorithms. Whenever my algorithms professor explained a concept, I would immediately go to YouTube to watch someone illustrating it step by step, often an Indian tutorial that made everything click.

Before this, I had already experimented with [[üïπÔ∏è Projects/Algorithm Visualizer\|Algorithm Visualizer]] in Godot, but like it, existing algorithm visualizers online are often limited to predefined algorithms and not customizable. Manim DSA solves this by giving users flexibility to animate any algorithm or data structure.

This project is also the first step toward creating my own educational content for YouTube, inspired by the style of 3Blue1Brown.
