# This website

[This website](https://github.com/F4bbi/my-digital-garden) is my **digital garden**, a growing collection of notes, essays, and ideas I’m exploring over time.

A digital garden is a space for **imperfect, evolving ideas**, unlike a traditional blog. Notes and essays are **not strictly organized by date**, but instead grow organically as I add insights and reflections. For a deeper explanation, see [this page](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).

I built this website using the **digital-garden plugin for Obsidian**, the note-taking system I use daily. With just a click, my notes are synced and published as a static website. Special thanks to [Ole Eskild](https://github.com/oleeskild), the author of the plugin ❤️.
