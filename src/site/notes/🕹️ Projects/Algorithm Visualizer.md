# Algorithm Visualizer

[Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/F4bbi/algorithm-visualizer) was my first attempt at visualizing algorithms, built with the Godot game engine during a period when I wanted to become a game developer (I later realized how challenging that path is 😅).

In the end, I managed to animate only the Selection Sort, but I’m proud of what I accomplished, especially the animation of the indices on the array.

This project was the starting point that eventually led to [[🕹️ Projects/Manim DSA\|Manim DSA]], the project I am most proud of.
