# START Hack 2025

[START Hack 2025](https://github.com/F4bbi/start_hack_2025) was my **second hackathon**, held in St. Gallen, Switzerland. It’s Europe’s most entrepreneurial 36-hour hackathon, and if you’ve never done an hackathon, I highly recommend trying it at least once. It’s truly an unforgettable experience.

The challenge we chose focused on supporting the **United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)** as part of their key initiative: the **G20 Global Land Initiative**. Our goal was to **raise awareness about the severe environmental and socio-economic challenges faced by the Sahel region**.

### What We Built

We developed an **interactive web app** that:

- **Collects and visualizes historical data:** displays 20 years of data on precipitation, land cover, and population density in the Sahel.
    
- **Integrates future projections using ML:** provides forecasts for the next 10 years to highlight potential trends (using ARIMA).
    
- **Offers interactive support:** includes a chatbot powered by ChatGPT that answers user questions and helps navigate the data.
    

We built the app using **Streamlit**, **ARIMA**, **Infomaniak** and **ChatGPT API** for the chatbot.

In conclusion, I don’t think I’ve ever learned so much in such a short time. I was really proud of what we managed to create, even though we ultimately placed 4th out of 28 teams. One of the most valuable lessons I learned is surely how crucial the pitch is in an hackathon :)
