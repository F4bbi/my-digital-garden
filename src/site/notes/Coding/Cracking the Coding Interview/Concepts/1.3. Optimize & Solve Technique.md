# Optimize & Solve Technique
## Look for BUD
It's an acronym for:
- Bottlenecks
- Unnecessary work
- Duplicated work

## Data Structure Brainstorm
We simply run through a list of data structures and try to apply each one.
#### Example
Keep track of the median of an array.
#### Structure Brainstorm
- **Linked list?** Probably not.
- **Array?** Maybe keep it sorted? It's expensive.
- **Binary tree?** Could be possible.
- **Heap?** You may use two heaps, one for the first half of the array (it will be a max heap) and one for the second half of the array (it will be a min heap). Best solution!
