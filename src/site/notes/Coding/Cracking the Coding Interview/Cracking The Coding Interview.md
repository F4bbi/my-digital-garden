Cracking the Coding Interview is a book written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, which is intended to help job seekers prepare for technical interviews at software companies. It also includes information on various topics such as big O notation, data structures and algorithms, and 189 programming interviewÂ questions, ranging from the basics to the trickiest algorithm problems.

Here you will find my notes about the concepts explained in the book (for chapters) and my problem solutions.
