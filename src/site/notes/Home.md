$$\huge{\text{Hi!}}$$

My name is Fabio and that cute creature you see up there is my cat, Minì. 🥰
I'm a second-year master's student in Computer Science at the University of Trento, Italy.
I'm currently on Erasmus in Gothenburg, Sweden.

**What is this site?** It's my [Digital Garden](https://github.com/F4bbi/my-digital-garden). In short, it's an evolving and expanding set of notes, essays and ideas I try to keep about everything I do. If you are curious you may take a look at my solutions for [[👨🏼‍💻 Coding/📝 Cracking the Coding Interview/Cracking The Coding Interview\|Cracking The Coding Interview]] or at my [[🎓 University notes (mostly in Italian)/⚙️ Algoritmi e Strutture Dati/1. Risolvere le ricorrenze\|Algorithm and Data Structures notes]] (in italian 😔).

### More about me :)

Here are a few things I'm currently into: 

- Getting into competitive programming — I even had the chance to teach a high school course on it!
- Maintaining my favorite self-made library for animating algorithms and data structures: [manim-dsa](https://github.com/F4bbi/manim-dsa)
- Trying to participate in at least a couple of hackathons per year
- Keeping up with my gym routine (~~4 times a week for over a year now 💪~~ on a break 'cause of Erasmus :'))
- Skateboarding on weekends (been at it for 5 years!)
- Occasionally playing padel and ice-skating with friends
- When I find some spare time, I enjoy watching YouTube videos or reading about critical thinking, finance, mathematics, and cooking
- Tried more than once to create my own video game using Godot game engine, but I always ended up losing motivation and dropping everything. In the end, I just used it to [animate a couple of algorithms](https://github.com/F4bbi/algorithm-visualizer)—badly (it's incomplete and full of bugs). I guess game dev isn’t really my thing… but I still dream about it! 🥹
