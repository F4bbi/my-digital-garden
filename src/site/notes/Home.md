$$\huge{\text{Hi!}}$$

My name is Fabio and that cute creature you see up there is my cat, MinÃ¬. ðŸ¥°
I'm a computer science student currently at the second year of University of Trento, in Italy.
**What is this site?**Â It's myÂ [Digital Garden](https://github.com/F4bbi/my-digital-garden). In short, it's an evolving and expanding set of notes, essays and ideas I try to keep about everything I do. If you are curious you may take a look at my solutions for [[Coding/Cracking the Coding Interview/Cracking The Coding Interview\|Cracking The Coding Interview]] or at my [[University notes (in Italian)/Algoritmi e Strutture Dati/1. Risolvere le ricorrenze\|Algorithm and Data Structures notes]] (in italian ðŸ˜”).

About my passions, I have lost track of all the skills I wish to learn such as cooking, writing a videogame, getting into competitive programming, and a lot of other things that I already know I will never be able to become decent at. But at the moment I really like getting better at skateboarding.
