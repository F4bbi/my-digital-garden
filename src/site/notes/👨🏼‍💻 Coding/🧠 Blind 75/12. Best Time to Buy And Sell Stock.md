# 12. Best Time to Buy And Sell Stock
#leetcode/121
## Problem [ðŸ”—](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)
You are given an arrayÂ `prices`Â whereÂ `prices[i]`Â is the price of a given stock on theÂ `ith`Â day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing aÂ **single day**Â to buy one stock and choosing aÂ **different day in the future**Â to sell that stock.

ReturnÂ _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, returnÂ `0`.

**Example:**
```
Input: prices = [7, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
```

## Solution
#### Solution in C++ using two pointers
Let's understand this problem by an imagination.Â ImagineÂ you have given a time machine, you can go toÂ past toÂ buyÂ theÂ stockÂ of your choice when the price is very least. And again using that time machine went intoÂ futureÂ toÂ sellÂ theÂ stock.
By doing that you have achieveÂ maximum profit. FromÂ buying at very least price and selling at very higher price, you have become rich now!

Now let's just understand it with our given example. Remember one rule: You can only buy one time & sell one time.
1. IfÂ we buy at 7Â andÂ sell at any time in the future, we'll face loss
2. Now, I have seen a dip, IÂ try to buy at 2 andÂ see what's next...
3. Oh no, another dip! Then, IÂ try to buy at 1 andÂ see what's next...
4. I can sell at 5.Â My overall profitÂ will beÂ 5 - 1 = 4. We have achieved our maximum profit so far, put it aside.
5. I could sell at 3... but then my profit would beÂ 3 - 1 = 2 < 4. We don't like it.
6. I can sell at 6.Â My overall profitÂ will beÂ 6 - 1 = 5. We have achieved our maximum profit so far, put it aside.
7. I could sell at 4... but then my profit would beÂ 4 - 1 = 3 < 5. We don't like it.
8. We have achieved our maximum profit, we can return our answer.

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
	int maxSoFar = 0, n = prices.size();

	for(int low = 0, high = 1; high < n; high++) {
		if(prices[low] >= prices[high])
			low = high;
		else
			maxSoFar = max(maxSoFar, prices[high] - prices[low]);
	}
	return maxSoFar;
}
```
- **Time complexity:** $O(n)$ (where _n_ is the size of the vector)
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

After we sell, you can see we don't care if the price goes down, we won't get greater profit.
As a result, we can move forward until we achieve greater profit or until the price goes reaally low (below the price we bought the stock).

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
	int n = prices.size(), low = 0, high = 1, maxSoFar = 0;
	
	while(high < n) {
		if(prices[low] >= prices[high]) {
			low = high;
			high++;
		}
		else {
			maxSoFar = max(maxSoFar, prices[high] - prices[low]);
			int currHigh = high;
			while (
					high < n &&
					prices[currHigh] >= prices[high] && 
					prices[high] > prices[low])
				high++;
		}
	}
	return maxSoFar;
}
```

- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$
