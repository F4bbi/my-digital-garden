# 6. Product of Array Except Self
#leetcode/238
## Problem [ðŸ”—](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self)
Given an integer arrayÂ `nums`, returnÂ _an array_Â `answer`Â _such that_Â `answer[i]`Â _is equal to the product of all the elements of_Â `nums`Â _except_Â `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix ofÂ `nums`Â isÂ **guaranteed**Â to fit in aÂ **32-bit**Â integer.

## Solution
#### Solution in C++ using brute force
The simplest method that comes to mind is, we can loop through the complete array using a pointer, sayÂ `j`, for every indexÂ `i`, and multiply all the elements at indexÂ `j`Â except whenÂ `i == j`. This would ensure that we skip the element at indexÂ `i`Â from being multiplied.

```cpp
vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(n);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = 1;
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(i != j)
                    ans[i] *= nums[j];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
- **Time complexity:** $O(n^2)$ (where _n_ is the size of the vector)
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

#### Solution in C++ using the division operation
What we would do is, we would find the product of all the numbers of our array and then divide the product with each element of the array to get the new element for that position in our final answer array. The problem going with this method is when we have aÂ `0`Â in our array. In fact, we can't perform a division byÂ `0`, as a result, we won't be able to get corresponding values in our final answer array for the indices havingÂ `0`Â in our initial array at that position.
However, we can fix this problem by keeping the count of zeros in the array.
1. If the count of zeros is 0 there are no problem, we just need to divide the product of array with every element.
2. If the count of zeros is greater than 1, the array will be empty.  
3. If the count of zeros is 1, we need to find the index of the zero and the product of the array without the zero. Then we just place the product at the index of the zero and we are done.

```cpp
vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
	int n = nums.size();
	vector<int> ans(n, 0);
	int zeroCount = 0;
	int prod = 1;

	for(int num : nums) {
		if(num != 0)
			prod *= num;
		else if(++zeroCount == 2)
			return ans; 
	}
	for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		if(zeroCount == 1)
			ans[i] = nums[i] != 0 ? 0 : prod;
		else
			ans[i] = prod / nums[i];
	}
	return ans;
}
```
- **Time complexity:** $O(n)$ (where _n_ is the size of the vector)
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

#### Solution in C++ using Prefix Product and Suffix Product tecnique
Here's a smart idea. We can calculate lefts product and rights product of every element in 2 loops. Finally, we multiply them and we push the result in the result array. For example:

```
Numbers:       2      3      4       5
Lefts:         1      2    2*3   2*3*4
Rights:    3*4*5    4*5      5       1
Output:  1*3*4*5  2*4*5  2*3*5 1*2*3*4
```

If we allocate an array for lefts product and one for rights product, the space complexity would be $O(n)$. To make it $O(1)$, we just need to store lefts product and rights product in two variables.

```cpp
vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
	int n = nums.size();
	vector<int> ans(n, 0);
	int left = ans[0] = 1;
	int right = ans[n - 1] = 1;

	//calculate left product for every element
	for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		left *= nums[i - 1];
		ans[i] = left;
	}

	//calculate right product for every element and multiply with left product
	for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
		right *= nums[i + 1];
		ans[i] *= right;
	}

	return ans;
}
```
