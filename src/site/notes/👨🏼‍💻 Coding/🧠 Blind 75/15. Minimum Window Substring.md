# 15. Minimum Window Substring
#leetcode/76
## Problem [ðŸ”—](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring)
Given two stringsÂ `s`Â andÂ `t`Â of lengthsÂ `m`Â andÂ `n`Â respectively, return theÂ minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t`Â (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, returnÂ the empty string `""`.

The test cases will be generated such that the answer isÂ **unique**.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

## Solution
#### Solution in C++ using two hash maps
Here's the process:
1. Create arrays `t_map` and `s_map` of size 128 to store character frequency information. `t_map` stores the frequency of characters in string `t`, while `s_map` stores the frequency of characters in the current window of string `s`.
2. Populate `t_map` with the frequency of characters in string `t`.
3. Iterate through the characters in string `s` using two pointers, `low` (left) and `high` (right).
4. For each character at index `high`, check if it exists in `t_map`. If not, skip it.
5. If the character exists in `t_map`, update its frequency in `s_map` and check if the frequency in `s_map` is less than or equal to the frequency in `t_map`. If it is, increment `t_counter` to keep track of how many characters from `t` have been found.
6. When `t_counter` reaches `n` (meaning all characters from `t` have been found in the current window), check if the current window's length (`high - low + 1`) is smaller than the current minimum length (`minLength`). If it is, update `minLength` and `minStart` with the current window's information.
7. Shrink the window from the left side (increment `low`) and update `s_map` and `t_counter` accordingly to search for a smaller window.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 until you have iterated through the entire string `s`.
9. After the loop, check if a valid minimum window was found (i.e., `minLength` is still equal to its initial value). If a valid minimum window exists, return that window using `s.substr(minStart, minLength)`. If no valid window exists, return an empty string.

```cpp
string minWindow(string s, string t) {
	int minLength = INT_MAX, minStart = 0, m = s.size(), n = t.size(), t_counter = 0;
	array<int, 128> t_map = {};
	array<int, 128> s_map = {};
	string res;

	//get the frequency of each element in t
	for(char c : t)
		t_map[c]++;

	for(int low = 0, high = 0; high < m; high++) {
		//if the current character is not in t, skip!
		if(!contains(t_map, s[high]))
			continue;
		//otherwise, there are some checks to do...
		
		//first, update the frequency of the character
		s_map[s[high]]++;
		//increment t_counter if we are not in sur plus of s[high]
		if(s_map[s[high]] <= t_map[s[high]])
			t_counter++;
		//we have found all the needed characters!
		while(t_counter == n) {
			//maybe it's the minimum substring so far...
			if(high - low + 1 < minLength) {
				//yes, it's the minimum! Remind its length..
				minLength = high - low + 1;
				//remind the start position of the string
				minStart = low;
			}
		
			/* 
				now we try to shrink the substring from left,
				hoping to find a smaller string...
			*/
			
			//update the frequency of the character
			s_map[s[low]]--;
			//if we haven't enough characters anymore, decrease t_counter
			if(contains(t_map, s[low]) && s_map[s[low]] < t_map[s[low]])
				t_counter--;
			low++;
		}
	}
	return minLength != INT_MAX ? s.substr(minStart, minLength) : "";
}

bool contains(const array<int, 128>& map, const int& val) {
	return map[val] >= 1;
}
```
- **Time complexity:** $O(n)$ (where _n_ is the size of the string)
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$  (`t_map` and `s_map` will always have 128 elements)
