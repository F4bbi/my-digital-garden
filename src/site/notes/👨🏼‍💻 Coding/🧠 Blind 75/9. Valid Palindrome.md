# 9. Valid Palindrome
#leetcode/125
## Problem [ðŸ”—](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome)
A phrase is aÂ **palindrome**Â if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a stringÂ `s`, returnÂ `true`Â _if it is aÂ **palindrome**, or_Â `false`Â _otherwise_.

## Solution
#### Solution in C++ using two pointers
The solution is very simple.
- If a character is not alphanumeric we can simply ignore it and update our pointer to the next character (for both pointers)
- If the two compared characters aren't equal, we can return false
- If the two compared characters are equal, we update both pointers and continue

Finally, after checking all characters, the string must be a valid palindrome so we can return true.

```cpp
bool isPalindrome(string s) {
	for(int start = 0, end = s.size() - 1; start < end;) {
		/* If s[start] is a num we can drop it */
		if(!isalnum(s[start]))
			start++;
		/* If s[end] is a num we can drop it */
		else if(!isalnum(s[end]))
			end--;
		/* If the two compared characters aren't equal, return false */
		/* We don't need to care about doing tolower() on a number, it will return the same result for both number */
		else if(tolower(s[start]) != tolower(s[end]))
			return false;
		/* If the two compared characters are equal */
		else {
			start++;
			end--;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
```
- **Time complexity:** $O(n)$ (where _n_ is the size of the string)
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$
