# 18. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
#leetcode/33
## Problem [🔗](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

## Solution
#### Solution in C++ using recursion
The idea is similar to [[👨🏼‍💻 Coding/🧠 Blind 75/17. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array\|17. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array]], with some changes. There are several cases to consider:
1. If `i > j`, it means the search range is empty, and the target element is not found in the array. In this case, `-1` is returned to indicate that the target is not present.
2. If the target element is equal to `nums[m]`, it means the target is found at index `m`, and `m` is returned as the result.
3. If `nums[m] >  nums[j]`, it suggests that the pivot point (where the array was rotated) is somewhere to the right of `m`. In this case, two conditions are checked:
	- If `target >= nums[m]` or `target <= nums[j]`, it means that the target lies in the right subarray. The search is continued in the right subarray by calling `searchRec` recursively with the range from `m + 1` to `j`.
	  You can see this with `nums = [1,2,3,4,0], target = 3` and with `nums = [2,3,4,0,1], target = 0`.
1. If `nums[m] < nums[j]`, it suggests that the pivot point is somewhere to the left of `m`. In this case, two conditions are checked:
	- If `target >= nums[m]` and `target <= nums[j]`, it means that the target lies in the right subarray. The search is continued in the right subarray by calling `searchRec` recursively with the range from `m + 1` to `j`.
	  You can see this with `nums = [0,1,2,3,4], target = 3`.
2. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that the target is in the left subarray. The search is continued in the left subarray by calling `searchRec` recursively with the range from `i` to `m - 1`.

Here's the implementation.

```cpp
int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
	return searchRec(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1, target);
}
int searchRec(vector<int>& nums, int i, int j, int target) {
	int m = (i + j) / 2;
	if(i > j)
		return -1;
	else if(target == nums[m])
	   return m;
	else if(nums[m] > nums[j] &&
			(target >= nums[m] ||
			target <= nums[j])
			)
		return searchRec(nums, m + 1, j, target);
	else if(nums[m] < nums[j] &&
		(target >= nums[m] &&
		target <= nums[j])
		)
	return searchRec(nums, m + 1, j, target);
	else    
		return searchRec(nums, i, m - 1, target);
}
```
- **Time complexity:** $O(log(n))$ (where _n_ is the size of the vector)
- **Space complexity:** $O(log(n))$ (we are using recursion)

#### Solution in C++ without recursion
For the sake of completeness, here's the iterative implementation.

```cpp
int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
	int i = 0, j = nums.size() - 1;

	while(i <= j) {
		int m = (i + j) / 2;
		if(nums[m] == target)
			return m;
		else if(nums[m] > nums[j] && (target >= nums[m] || target <= nums[j]))
			i = m + 1;
		else if(nums[m] < nums[j] && target >= nums[m] && target <= nums[j])
			i = m + 1;
		else
			j = m - 1;
	}
	return -1;
}
```
- **Time complexity:** $O(log(n))$ (where _n_ is the size of the vector)
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$
