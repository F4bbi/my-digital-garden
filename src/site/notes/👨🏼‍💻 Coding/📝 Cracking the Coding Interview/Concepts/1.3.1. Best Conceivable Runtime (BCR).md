# Best Conceivable Runtime (BCR)
> The Best Conceivable Runtime is the best runtime you could conceive of a solution to a problem having. 

#### Example
You want to compute the number of elements that two arrays have in common. You already know that you can't do better than $O(A+B)$ time because you have to "touch" each element in each array. $O(A+B)$ is the BCR.

>[!warning] Be careful!
>Suppose you have to find all pairs with sum _k_ within an array.
>It's wrong to say that you can't do better of $O(N^2)$ because you have to look at $N^2$ pairs. See [[👨🏼‍💻 Coding/🕵🏼‍♀️ LeetCode Problems/Pairs of Integers with difference k\|Pairs of Integers with difference k]]

Remember that the best conceivable runtime is not necessarily achievable. It says only that you can't do _better_ than it.
Last thing, if you ever reach the BCR and have $O(1)$ additional space, then you know that you can't optimize the big O time or space.
