# Fabbi's Digital Garden
This is the source code for [fabio-missagia.netlify.app](https://fabio-missagia.netlify.app), a digital garden filled with growing notes, essays, and eventual projects in mind.

**But what is a digital garden?**

As i said, a digital garden is a collection of imperfect notes, essays, and ideas growing slowly over time. 
Unlike a blog, a garden is a collection of ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. Here you will find all my notes written in Obsidian during my journey on computer science about data structures, algorithms, probability and statistics and more.
